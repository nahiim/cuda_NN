# cuda_NN

A fully GPU-accelerated feedforward neural network implemented in CUDA to learn the XOR logic gate. This project demonstrates how to implement parallelized inference and backpropagation using CUDA kernels without using any deep learning frameworks.

## Build

- Requires CUDA Toolkit and Visual Studio.
- Simply uild and run to in Visual Studio to see inference results.
